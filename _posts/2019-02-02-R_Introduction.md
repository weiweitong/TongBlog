# R_Introduction
## Reasoning
The capacity to make sense of things or to establish and verify facts.<br>
For this subject, we look at reasoning from the perspective of computers.<br>
We look at approaches that allow machines to make a decision similar to the reasoning process.<br>

## Deductive reasoning
A form of reasoning in which a conclusion follows logically and coherently from the factual premises and proposition. <br>
#### Example:
If x=2 and y=16 Then 2*xy=512<br><br>
It is cold in the mountains. The city of Tredbo is in the mountains. Thus, it is cold in the city of Thredbo.

## Inductive reasoning
Uses analogies, examples, observations, and experiences to form conclusive propositions.
#### Example:
Smoking increases the risk of lung cancer. This suggests
that the risk of lung cancer is reduced by not smoking.

## Abductive reasoning
Is an argument to the best explanation. The premise is often incomplete.
#### Example:
Thousands die every year while driving a car. I will be dead
soon because I drive a car.

## Fallacious reasoning
Not real reasoning, it is the faulty premises for critical thinking and logic. Usually refers to an error in reasoning, or a false premise.
#### Example:
A fortune teller tell me that I will be rich. Therefore, I will be rich soon.

The process of acquiring new knowledge or skills.<br>
Again, we attempt to achieve this with machines.
Often achieved by simulating biological analogues.
Reasoning and learning are both aspects of what is considered about intelligence and are often interdependent.<br>
Reasoning has been classified as classical or symbolic AI.<br>
Learning has been a topic of machine learning and neural networks in the area of computational intelligence.
