# Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. 
# Don't be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people's thinking. 

# Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. 
# And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. 
# They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 

# Everything else is secondary.
